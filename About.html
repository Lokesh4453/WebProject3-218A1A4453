        <h3>Biryanies..</h3>
        <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora
            Although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.
            Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.

        <h3>South Thali</h3>

        <h3>Roties..</h3>
        <p>
            Phulka Rotis is India's one of the most versatile flatbreads. 
            These Rotis appear frequently in Gujarati households and are popular throughout North India. 
            I am sharing an easy step-by-step recipe along with a video to make these flatbreads with you guys today.
            Every Indian household has its own way of making these flatbreads. 
            It is different from region to region, village to village, and home to home. 
            A very small example, the rotis we make have to be paper-thin, soft, and not too many charred marks on them. 
            While rotis at my maternal grandma's home, are a little thicker, soft, and should be filled with charred marks. 
            They will find the rotis uncooked without charred marks.
